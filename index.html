        <h3>Verse 1: Ice Cube</h3>
        <p>Here's a little somethin' 'bout a (slur) like me
            Never should've been let out the penitentiary
            Ice Cube would like to say
            That I'm a crazy muthafucka from around the way
            Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
            Now I'm the muthafucka that you read about
            Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
            You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
            This is a gang, and I'm in it
            My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
            With a right-left, right left ya toothless
            And then you say "Goddamn, they ruthless!"
            Everywhere we go they say "Damn!"
            N.W.A's fuckin' up the program
            And then you realize we don't care
            We don’t just say no, we’re too busy sayin' "Yeah!"
            About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
            Do I look like a muthafuckin' role model?
            To a kid lookin' up to me
            Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
            'Cause I'm the type of (slur) that's built to last
            If you fuck with me, I’ll put my foot in your ass
            See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
            Yo! What the fuck are they yellin'?</p>

            It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
            <span>Gangsta! Gangsta!</span>
            Hopin' you sophisticated muthafuckaz hear what I have to say</p>

        <h3>Verse 2: Ice Cube</h3>
        <p>When me and my posse stepped in the house
            All the punk-ass (slur) start breakin' out
            'Cause you know, they know what’s up
            So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
            Like her, but she keep cryin'
            "I got a boyfriend" — bitch, stop lyin'!
            Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
            Suddenly, I see some (slur) that I don't like
            Walked over to 'em, and said "What's up?"
            The first (slur) that I saw — hit him in the jaw
            Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
            By that time, got rushed by security
            Out the door, but we don't quit
            Ren said "Let's start some shit!"
            I got a shotgun, and here's the plot:
            Takin' (slur) out with a flurry of buck shots
            Boom! Boom! Boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
            And then you look, all you see is (slur) runnin'
            And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin' and cussin'
            I stepped back and I kept bustin'
            And then I realized it's time for me to go
            So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
            It's like this, because of that who-ride
            N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
            'Cause I'm the type of (slur) that's built to last
            Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
            See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
            Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?</p>

        <h3>Verse 3: Ice Cube</h3>
        <p>Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
            Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
            We decide to roll and we deep
            See a (slur) on Dayton's and we creep
            Real slow, and before you know
            I had my shotgun pointed in the window
            He got scared and hit the gas
            Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
            He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
            We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
            Then we headed right back to the fort
            Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
            We didn't get no play from the ladies
            With six (slur) in a car — are you crazy?
            She was scared, and it was showin'
            We all said "Fuck you, bitch!" and kept goin'
            To the hood, and we was fin to
            Find somethin' else to get into
            Like some pussy, or in fact
            A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
            On a (slur) for nothin' at all
            Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
            I might stumble, but still won't lose
            Now I'm dressed in the county blues
            'Cause I'm the type of (slur) that's built to last
            If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
            I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'

            (What we're gonna do right here is go back)

        <p>Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
            (slur) tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
            Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
            I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
            With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
            Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
            'Cause I'm the E — I don't slang or bang
            I just smoke muthafuckaz like it ain't no thang!
            And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
            "We wanna fuck you, Eazy!" I wanna fuck you too!
            Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
            So let me tell you muthafuckaz who you're fuckin' with
            'Cause I'm the type of (slur) that's built to last
            If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
